# Yaro Frontend Take-Home Project

## Overview

Your task is to build upon a React Native application that helps users find surgeons for various surgery categories. The application currently has one screen built out, which lists various categories of surgery. You will need to add the screen which shows cards for each surgeon in a given category. We would like you to mimic the design found in the `/designs` directory.

**NOTE: We do not expect a perfectly accurate recreation of the design, as some of the information present in the design is not returned from the backend server.** Don't worry about the drawing of the doctor, or the bottom navbar, for example. We are just looking to see that you are capable of recreating someone else's design. Feel free to make your own design choices If you'd like more design inspiration, check out the full design [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/79318313/GangnamSister-App-Case-Study?tracking_source=search%7CHealthcare%20App).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure that you have [Yarn] installed on your machine.
3. Run the terminal command `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run the terminal command `expo start` and follow the instructions in the terminal to run the app on a mobile simulator. **NOTE: You must be on a Mac to run the iPhone simulator. Otherwise, you'll have to develop using the Android simulator.**
